# MachineLearning-FromScratch

This repository contains a set of prjects in with I have implemented machine learning algorithms (classification and clustering) from scratch without help of high level libraries such as Sklearn or even Pandas.In these algorithms, I've tried to use the vectorized operations of Numpy to make the computations more efficient. These algorithms are the result of my tutoring classes with my students from university of Harvard, UCLA, ... .

  - #### Kmeans and HAC:
    on MNIST : In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Kmeans and Hierarchical Aglomorative Clustering (HAC) on MNIST data from scracth using only Numpy. 
  
  - #### Mixture Models
    In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm on a geometrically distributed data from scracth using only Numpy. 
  
  - #### PCA:
    Clustering MNIST: In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on MNIST data from scracth using only Numpy.
  
  - #### VideoStoreApplication: 
    In this project me and a M.Sc. Student from UCIrvine implemented a VideoStore Manager program in with we practiced advance concepts of object-oriented programming such as polymorphism, MVC design and inheritence and data structures such as singly linked list, doubly linked list, Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL.
