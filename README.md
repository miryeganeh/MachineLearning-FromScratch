# MachineLearning-FromScratch

This repository contains a set of prjects in Python and Java which are the results of my one-to-one tutoring sessions with my students: 

  - #### Kmeans and HAC:
    on MNIST : In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Kmeans and Hierarchical Aglomorative Clustering (HAC) on MNIST data from scracth using only Numpy. 
  
  - #### Mixture Models
    In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm on a geometrically distributed data from scracth using only Numpy. 
  
  - #### PCA:
    Clustering MNIST: In this project me and a student of M.Sc. from university of Harvard implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on MNIST data from scracth using only Numpy.
  
  - #### VideoStoreApplication: 
    In this project me and a M.Sc. Student from UCIrvine implemented a VideoStore Manager program in with we practiced advance concepts of object-oriented programming such as polymorphism, MVC design and inheritence and data structures such as singly linked list, doubly linked list, Binary Search Tree (BST) and AVL. 
  
  
  - #### KNN: 
    In this project me and a M.Sc. Student from Oregonstate implemented K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to classify a dataset of people to predict the salary of people. 
  
  - #### Perceptron: 
    In this project me and a M.Sc. Student from Oregonstate implemented Perceptron algorithm to classify a dataset of people to predict the salary of people. 
    
  - #### LogisticRegression: 
    In this project me and a M.Sc. Student from Oregonstate implemented Logistic Regression algorithm predict the sale price of houses.
